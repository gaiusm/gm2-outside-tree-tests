gm2-outside-tree-tests
======================

A small repository containing scripts to create a source tree and
attempt to build the source code using gm2.  This repository contains
the URLs to other public modula-2 project repositories and contains
a simplistic scripted method to build all these projects.

Since these repositories are active there is no guarantee that they will
all pass.  However it is expected that: pge, chess-shell and penguin-tower
will always build with the latest development version of gm2.
